I am currently working on a brand new version with different options

# unofficial-BeamMP-Server-installer

!!!Does not work with the server beta version!!!

This is a third party script. I am not a developer of BeamMP and I am not on the BeamMP team. Otherwise, I just found it can be too hard for some to get beammp running properly.

# Supported BeamMP version
Installer:
[2.2.0](https://github.com/BeamMP/BeamMP-Server/tree/v2.2.0)

Server run:
[2.2.0](https://github.com/BeamMP/BeamMP-Server/tree/v2.1.1) and [Beta](https://discord.com/channels/601558901657305098/714903107573776394)

# Instructions:
 1. Install git install git for cloning the repository: `apt install git`
 1. Download the install script: `git clone https://github.com/KIznaiver-system/unofficial-BeamMP-Server-installer.git`
 2. Give the script rights to execute: `chmod +x install`
 3. Start the script: `./install`
 
# The server script works like this
  1. Start server: `./server start`
  2. Stop server: `./server stop`
  3. Restart server: `./server restart`
  6. Console of the server: `./server terminal`
